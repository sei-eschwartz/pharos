% Long ago, Ed wrote: A solution is <list of classes, a mapping of classes to methods, a
% mapping of classes to members, a mapping of each class to its immediate parents and offset, a
% list of vtables, mapping of vtables to class x offset x size, map of virtual function calls
% to classes and methods, special methods of class>.  Now it's more correct to say something
% like: "A solution is a list of finalXXX() predicates contained in this section".

% These rules are for formatting the results into "final" format.  These rules are not used for
% reasoning, and do not involve guessing or backtracking in any way.  As a consequence it's not
% obvious that they need to be tabled (although there's probably no harm in that).

% ejs: It sure would be nice if there was a consistent prolog library...

% ============================================================================================

% We've found that under some circumstances (see https://github.com/cmu-sei/pharos/issues/101)
% vftables can be reused on different classes.  We believe this is only when no methods are
% overridden. Here is an example.

%% Concluding factVFTableWrite(0x70d682, 0x70d650, 0, 0xa2c85c).
%% Concluding factVFTableWrite(0x70d147, 0x70d0a0, 0x16c, 0x9ae574).
%% Concluding factVFTableWrite(0x70d133, 0x70d0a0, 0, 0xa2c85c).

% Ed thought there were two possibilities:

%% 1. Both classes inherit from a common base class but don't override any functions. Class
%% 0x70d0a0 inherits from another class as well.

%% 2. Class 0x70d0a0 inherits from 0x70d650 and
%% another class, and does not override any methods from 0x70d650. Normally we'd see a vftable
%% overwrite, but since the vftables are the same we might not.

%% This predicate adds an extra check to make sure that there is exactly one class that claims
%% ownership of the VFTable.  Right now we only envision it being used in final.pl, hence the
%% name.
