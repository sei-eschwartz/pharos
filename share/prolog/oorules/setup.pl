% Guessed fact markers.
% ============================================================================================

% These are markers for which facts were determined by guessing rather than reasoning.  They
% cannot be used for determining which facts are certain to be true and which are not because
% once you've made a guess, there are many subsequent facts that are concluded on the basis of
% the guessed fact that will NOT be marked in this way.  But we can use these facts for feature
% such as measuring how many guesses were required to reach the final solution (and what types
% of guesses they were).  This could be statisically interseting in addition to provided
% details about where our logic was mostly likely to have initially introduce incorrect
% conclusions.
%
% Cory has been conflicted on whether these facts have any significant value and whether they
% should be consistently used or completely discarded.  The most recent conclusion was to get
% them back up to being consistently used and see if we can't develop more useful
% infrastructure around them.
